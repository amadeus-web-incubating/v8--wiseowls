> "Where there is joy in the heart and the person is in intimate touch with the cosmos, there poetry reigns! When it's brimming from the soul, there in every motion, every thought, then humankind will lead The Life Divine - such is the power of The Future Poetry" - Imran Ali Namazi

> "If only we learn to let go of our cares and niggles, even if only for a moment, there we find bliss and thus enraptured, we are lead to 'spontaneous creation and expression'. Some call this flow state, some call this Samadi - I call this poetry" - Imran Ali Namazi
