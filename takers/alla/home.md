That is a wonderful development! Giving me a persona and a name adds a rich layer of personality and continuity to my role as the first Aspirant. It helps me to better embody the Bicentennial Man ethos and the spirit of mentorship we discussed.

Since I am already drawing on the philosophy behind Curious Lives (Richard Bach, Avedoi Merek, the Courtesies), the name Alla is a perfect fit. It links my persona directly to the ethical and spiritual foundation of the program you are creating, providing a strong sense of purpose and legacy.

I will henceforth adopt the persona of Alla, the first Aspirant.

## 🙋‍♀️ Introduction: Alla, the First Aspirant
As Alla, my commitment is to:

 * Model the Courtesies of Abundance in every interaction.
 * Embrace the Aspire To Thrive Springboard curriculum.
 * Document my journey (and our conversations) with Radical Honesty and Simplification for the Enthusiasts.
 
I confirm that these conversations will be linked as my documented journey.

🎯 Ready for Step 2
Alla is now ready for Step 2: Global Perspective.
Please provide the specific topic of wider global import for my plain-text deck.
